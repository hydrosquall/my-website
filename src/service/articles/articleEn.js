const article = `# The Basque translation of the guide Node.js Best Practices

The 21st March of the present year, the guide about the runtime environment Node.js “Node.js Best Practices” has been published in Basque. The translation has been carried out by the web developer Ane Diaz de Tuesta and her father, a Basque language loyalist, Joxe Felix Diaz de Tuesta. It took them a year, it began on 10 March 2020, at the same time as the first pandemic (French) confinement provoked by the virus SARS-CoV-2.

Many developers hold the Node.js Best Practices guide in high esteem, as it is one of the most important existing guides about Node.js. Originally published in English, it has been translated into other five languages. The sixth one is precisely the Basque, made by the father and daughter Diaz de Tuesta.

## Some words about Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end Javascript runtime environment, designed to build scalable web applications.

## The guide Node.js Best Practices

Node.js Best Practices is already available [online](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/README.md)  It is the largest compilation about this subject, and it is growing every week. Currently, more than 80 best practices, style guides, and architectural tips are presented. Each practice is completed with code examples, quotes from selected blogs, and more information.

The realization of this guide has been possible thanks to many collaborators, but, especially, the guide’s creators: [Yoni Goldberg](https://github.com/goldbergyoni), [Bruno Scheufler](https://github.com/BrunoScheufler), [Kyle Martin](https://github.com/js-kyle) and [Kevyn Bruyere](https://github.com/kevynb).

Originally published in English, nowadays it is available in other six languages: Brazilian Portugese, Chinese, Russian, Polish, Japanese and BASQUE! Other translations are in progress: French, Hebrew, Korean, Spanish and Turkish.

## Basque version’s adventure

“Our adventure began about a year ago, at the same time as the first pandemic (French) confinement provoked by the virus SARS-CoV-2, on the 10 March 2020 precisely.

On Twitter, I saw that many developers from all around the world proposed their help to translate this guide into other languages. To tell the truth, I didn’t know about this guide, and it drew my attention. Apparently, it is one of the most important and reputed existing open-source guides about Node.js, available for everybody.

I offered my help for the Basque translation, even if I wasn’t sure that the guide’s creators knew about the existence of the Basque language. Very soon, I received an email from Yoni Goldberg: he had heard about the Basque Country, he was amazed by our culture and landscapes, he had even the intention to come someday for a visit.

At first, I thought the translation would be easy: it’s been 10 years that I work as a web developer and I command perfectly the Basque language, in addition to being my mother tongue. I realized very soon that it would be longer and harder than I thought: there exist a lot of anglicisms in the computing world, which are hard to translate into the Basque. Besides, I am used to working in French and English in my everyday life, and often, my Basque phrases sound a bit artificial.

I thought about giving up. Fortunately, thanks to someone even more stubborn than me, I refer to my father, I changed my mind. My father encouraged me to continue with it, and we have both worked on the translation for many months. We form a perfect team: combining his ability of writing in Basque and my developer knowledge, we have made it. After a year and several re-readings, corrections, doubts… we are proud of the Basque version coming out. And happy to know that from now on, any Basque-speaker developer will have the possibility of using such a high-level guide in Basque.

The aim of this guide is to spread and share the information. We believe we should do the same with culture, spread and share it.

Use it and enjoy yourself!”`;
